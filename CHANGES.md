# Change log for Handprint

## Version 1.5.1

There are no functional changes in this release; all of the code changes are internal, to speed up Handprint startup times and further clean up some code dependencies.

All changes in this release:

* To speed up initial application startup time, `import` statements have been moved from (usually) the tops of files, to where the packages are actually used in the code. Profiling using the Python `-X importtime` option helped identify expensive packages to make this efficiency gain possible.
* The user interface code in `ui.py` has been replaced with importing [Bun](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/bun).
* The version of `commonpy` needed is now 1.3.9.
* The dependency on [dateparser](https://github.com/scrapinghub/dateparser) has been removed because Handprint doesn't depend on that package.  (It's a transitive dependency coming from something else, but by itself, it doesn't belong in Handprint's requirements.)


## Version 1.5.0

This version contains many additions and some important bugs in the extended output (i.e., using the `-e` flag) for Google and Amazon. If you use Handprint, you should definitely update to this version.

All changes in this release:

* The default branch on GitHub has been changed from `master` to `main`. **If you have clones or forks of this repo**, please see GitHub's [instructions for updating a local clone after a branch name change](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/renaming-a-branch#updating-a-local-clone-after-a-branch-name-changes).
* The styling of text annotations has changed: the text boxes overlaid on images no longer have borders, so that they are easier to read, especially when bounding boxes are displayed using the `-d` option (see below).
* A new command-line option, `-d` (short for `--display`), lets users choose to display the bounding boxes of text, lines, and paragraphs (if the service supports these), in addition to or instead of the recognized text.
* A new command-line option, `-n` (short for `--confidence`), allows users to apply a threshold to the confidence values returned for individual results, such that only results having confidence scores above a given value are shown in the output.
* A new command-line option, `-j`, (short for `--reuse-json`) tells Handprint to look for the extended results produced by a previous run using  `-e`, and use that instead of contacting a service again.
* A new command-line option, `-m`, (short for `--text-move`) lets users adjust the position of the text annotations overlaid on input images. This takes two numbers separated by a comma in the form `x,y`.  Positive numbers move the text rightward and upward compared to the default position.
* A new command-line option, `-x`, (short for `--text-color`) allows users to change the color of the text annotations overlaid on input images.
* A new command-line option, `-z`, (short for `--text-size`) lets users change the font size of the text annotations overlaid on input images.
* The extended data (via option `-e`) from Google now includes the confidence scores enabled using the option [`enable_text_detection_confidence_score`](https://googleapis.github.io/google-cloud-dotnet/docs/Google.Cloud.Vision.V1/api/Google.Cloud.Vision.V1.TextDetectionParams.html) in the Google Vision API.
* Handprint no longer leaves resized versions of input images when the `-e` option is being used.  Previously, images of the form `somefile.handprint.png` were left around for `somefile.png` so that subsequent runs were saved the time of resizing the image (if resizing was needed).  However, this meant that subsequent runs would reuse the image even if the chosen destination services were different than in the run that produced the resized image, which meant that the subsequent runs might be using an unnecessarily small version of the image.  To eliminate this risk, Handprint now deletes the resized image, even though this means repeated runs on the same image may require repeated resizing operations.
* Fixed issue #27: the Google JSON output was not proper JSON.
* Fixed issue #26: the extended output for Amazon services was one long line instead of being split into lines as is done for the other services. This now works.
* Fixed issue #25: the extended output for Google in Handprint version 1.4.0 produced an empty text file. It now produces text.
* Fixed issue #24: use CommonPy functions instead of keeping separate versions of the same functions. Internally, a number of common utility functions originally written in part for Handprint have been moved to a separate new Python package, [Commonpy](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/commonpy), and the Handprint code has been refactored to use the package instead of its own copies of the functions.
* Fixed issue #23: updated service adapters to use the latest API versions of the services (specifically for the Microsoft API).
* Fixed issue #21: fixed Dependabot security warning for the `urllib3` package.
* Fixed issue #3: Microsoft API sometimes returned HTTP code 400; I rewrote the Handprint adapter code to handle errors more carefully and bubble up any unhandled errors so that users can see what they are.
* Fixed problems in the implementation of the base class for handwritten recognition services.
* Most dependencies in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) have been updated to the latest versions, and some new dependencies have been added.
* Various minor internal code cleanups have been made.
* The copyright year has been updated.


## Version 1.4.0

This release does not change the user interface or functionality, but this is more than a patch release because it changes the minimum required versions of many Python packages and uses newer Google API libraries.

* Fixed compatibility between Handprint and more recent versions of the Google API libraries.  **The previous versions of the Google API are no longer supported by Handprint**.
* Fixed a bug in the main routine causing an error when trying to print exceptions.
* Fixed a bug in catching errors in the Microsoft interface.
* Update [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) to remove no-longer used packages and update minimum version numbers.
* Update [`README.md`](README.md) to acknowledge the Python dependencies actually being used now.


## Version 1.3.0

* Handprint now requires Python version 3.6 or later.
* Fixed issue [#19](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/handprint/issues/19), which caused Handprint to fail to produce any output images if both `-e` and `-G` were given.
* Fixed warning about Matlplotlib GUIs and threading in `images.py`.
* Fixed macOS Mojave compatibility (issue [#16](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/handprint/issues/16).
* Updated `handprint/services/microsoft.py` to work with Azure API v. 3.0.
* Updated Microsoft credentials code to allow the endpoint URI to be supplied.
* Changed and expanded the possible exit codes returned by Handprint. (Please see the docs for more info.)
* Changed Google interface to retrieve _only_ document text results instead of all possible results, for better efficiency.
* Improved handling of `^C` interrupts from the command line.
* Added signal catcher to drop Handprint into `pdb` upon receiving `SIGUSER`.
* Switched to the use of [Sidetrack](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/sidetrack) for debug logging.
* Switched to the use of [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) for terminal output
* Various internal code updates and refactoring.


## Version 1.2.2

* Updated copyright year in various source files.


## Version 1.2.1

* Fixed Microsoft output in the annotated images to be word-based, rather than line-based, to be the same as for the other services.


## Version 1.2.0

* Two bugs related to running with multiple threads (the default) are hopefully fixed in this version:
  * Sometimes the annotated image generated from a given service would have the results from another service also written over it.  This was inconsistent and intermittent, and the exact cause is still unclear, but this version of Handprint implements a workaround that hopefully stops this from happening.
  * The Amazon service interface would sometimes fail with an error related to `endpoint_resolver`.  This was due to the previous code not following recommendations about using a different connection session object in each separate thread. This is now fixed.
* This version changes the way output files are named.  The new scheme always includes the string `handprint` in the file name for easier recognition and to help reduce the chances of file name collisions.  The scheme uses the naming pattern `somefile.handprint.png` for
the rescaled input image, `somefile.handprint-service.ext` for the
various service output results, and `somefile.handprint-all.png` for the
summary grid image.  (Issue #10.)
* PDF files are now accepted as input. (Issue #11.)  Note, however, that
Handprint will only extract the first image in the PDF file.
* The order in which resizing and rescaling is done has been swapped: if a file is too large, Handprint will first rescale it, and then if it is still too big (in byte size), it will resize the file.  This appears to result in images that have higher resolution than the previous approach, which did the steps in the opposite order.
* The URLs in the file of example URLs, `tests/urls/caltech-archives-urls.txt`, have become invalid. They have been replaced with other URLs that are valid (as of right now, anyway).
* A few more bugs have been fixed.


## Version 1.1.0

* Improve installation instructions and avoid telling people to use `sudo`.
* Add facility to compare extracted text to a ground truth file. This is enabled using the command-line option `-c`. See the README file or help text for more details.
* Add command-line option `-r` to adjust some of the behavior of `-c`. See the README file or help text for more details.
* Change the debug option `-@` to accept an argument for where to send the debug output trace. The behavior change of `-@` is not backward compatible.
* Internally, package metadata is now stored in `setup.cfg`.  Also, there is no `handprint/__version__.py` anymore, and instead, some special code in `handprint/__init__.py` extracts package-level variables directly from the installation created by `pip`.
* Most test images have been removed from `tests/images` and put instead in a more organized fashion in a separate repository, [htr-test-cases](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/htr-test-cases/).
* Add some missing package imports.


## Version 1.0.3

* Fix an internal bug getting the credentials file for Amazon services.


## Version 1.0.2

* Fix [issue #9](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/handprint/issues/9): credentials files are not saved in expected location.
* Edit the `README.md` file.


## Version 1.0.1

This version adds instructions for installing from PyPI and fixes a bug writing files downloaded from URLs.


## Version 1.0.0

This release provides a great many changes over the previous versions of Handprint.  The behavior and implementation have all changed in various ways, and collectively this marks the first version that can fairly be called version 1.0.0.

The following are some of the notable changes in this release:

* Credentials are now stored in a separate user directory; in additional, the process for installing credentials files is different, and involves invoking Handprint with the `-a` option.
* Handprint now calls services in parallel threads, to speed up processing.  The number of threads can be set via the `-t` option.
* To display the results of text recognition, Handprint now creates a summary image showing all service's results in an _N&nbsp;x&nbsp;N_ grid, thus allowing easy inspection and comparison of results across services.  By default, this is now the _only_ output that Handprint produces unless given the `-e` option.  With `-e`, Handprint also stores the raw data from the services and the pure text output.
* Images are now always sent to HTR services in PNG format, even when a service accepts other formats.  Source images will be converted to PNG if they are not already in that format.  (This simplifies processing and code flow.)
* Intermediate results files are now deleted unless the `-e` flag is given, reducing clutter and confusion.
* Some additional command-line arguments have been changed in backwards-incompatible ways.
* The [tests/images](tests/images) subdirectory has been reorganized, some previous images have been deleted, and some new ones have been added
* Internal code such as [network.py](handprint/network.py) has been updated to versions developed for other projects such as [Microarchiver](https://github/caltechlibrary/microarchiver).
* There are new command-line options.
* More bugs have been fixed in the code.
* More error checking has been added throughout.
* Much of the internal code has been refactored and rewritten.
* The repository now uses [READMINE](https://github.com/mhucka/readmine) structure for [README](README.md) file.
* Added code of conduct and contributor guidelines to the repository.


## Version 0.9.0

* **Backward-incompatible change**: command-line option `-m` is now `-s` and "methods" are now known as "services", to avoid conflicting interpretations of what a "method" is in the context of software.  Internal object classes have likewise been changed.
* Refactor some internal network code.
* Add a number of additional images for testing.


## Version 0.8.2

* Fix internal bug in file download code.
* Start separate file [CHANGES](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/handprint/blob/master/CHANGES.md) for the change log.


## Version 0.8.1

* Detect and handle when the Google API returns a badly-formed bounding box.
* Skip files previously generated by the annotation feature of Handprint.


## Version 0.8.0

Handprint now generates annotated images by default; they display the extracted text overlaid on the input images.


## Version 0.7.5

Separate chunks of text in Microsoft output using newlines, rather than spaces, to make the results more comparable to what Google produces.


## Version 0.7.4

This version improves efficiency by iterating over files/URLs first and then over methods, so that files do not get repeatedly downloaded each time a different method is used.  It also works around some network compatibility problems in different environments, and finally, adds a number of fixes.
