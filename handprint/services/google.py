    # General scheme of things:
    #
    # * Return errors (via TRResult) if a result could not be obtained
    #   because of an error specific to a particular path/item.  The guiding
    #   principle here is: if the calling loop is processing multiple items,
    #   can it be expected to be able to go on to the next item if this error
    #   occurred?
    #
    # * Raises exceptions if a problem occurs that should stop the calling
    #   code from continuing with this service.  This includes things like
    #   authentication failures, because authentication failures tend to
    #   involve all uses of a service and not just a specific item.
    #
    # * Otherwise, returns a TRResult if successful.
