# A missing load statement in colorful 0.53 (the currently-released version
# as of 2019-08-29) means the COLORNAMES_COLOR palette was actually not
# defined until version 0.54 (c.f. issue #31 and the commit at
# https://github.com/timofurrer/colorful/commit/8e3ea7293ca5a5d98aa427116211992088ffc9fc

# The following defines the basic styles we use in this application.
# Regarding the ones like 'bold': There are more possible using the Python
# colorful and other packages, but not all work on all platforms
# (particularly Windows) and not all are that useful in pratice.  Note: the
# following have to be defined after the palette above is loaded into
# "colorful", or else the colors used below will not be defined when the
# _COLORS dictionary is created at load time.
