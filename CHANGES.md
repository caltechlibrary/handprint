Change log for Handprint
========================

Version 0.10.0
--------------

* Add support for Amazon's Rekognition and Textract services.
* Use [READMINE](https://github.com/mhucka/readmine) structure for [README](README.md) file.
* Update some internal code such as [network.py](handprint/network.py) to versions developed for other projects such as [Microarchiver](https://github/caltechlibrary/microarchiver).
* Fix some small defects.
* Refactor some internal code.
* Add code of conduct and contributor guidelines.


Version 0.9.0
-------------

* **Backward-incompatible change**: command-line option `-m` is now `-s` and "methods" are now known as "services", to avoid conflicting interpretations of what a "method" is in the context of software.  Internal object classes have likewise been changed.
* Refactor some internal network code.
* Add a number of additional images for testing.


Version 0.8.2
-------------

* Fix internal bug in file download code.
* Start separate file [CHANGES](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/handprint/blob/master/CHANGES.md) for the change log.


Version 0.8.1
-------------

* Detect and handle when the Google API returns a badly-formed bounding box.
* Skip files previously generated by the annotation feature of Handprint.


Version 0.8.0
-------------

Handprint now generates annotated images by default; they display the extracted text overlaid on the input images.


Version 0.7.5
-------------

Separate chunks of text in Microsoft output using newlines, rather than spaces, to make the results more comparable to what Google produces.


Version 0.7.4
-------------

This version improves efficiency by iterating over files/URLs first and then over methods, so that files do not get repeatedly downloaded each time a different method is used.  It also works around some network compatibility problems in different environments, and finally, adds a number of fixes.
