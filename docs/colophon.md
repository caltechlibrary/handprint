# Colophon

This documentation was written by [Michael Hucka](https://www.cds.caltech.edu/~mhucka/) using the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) document generator together with [MyST-flavored Markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The theme is the [Material theme for Sphinx](https://bashtage.github.io/sphinx-material/), with light customizations such as the use of Google's [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible) font. A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/foliage/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-sphinx.yml) takes care of creating the formatted version of the documentation and hosting it on GitHub.io at https://caltechlibrary.github.io/foliage. The formatted output can also be produced manually using commands implemented in the `Makefile` located in the [`docs/`](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/foliage/tree/main/docs) subdirectory of the Foliage source code repository.

The [vector artwork](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=hand&i=733265) of a hand used as a logo for Handprint was created by [Kevin](https://thenounproject.com/kevn/) for the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com).

Unless indicated otherwise, all other artwork in this documentation was created using [OmniGraffle Pro](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) on a macOS computer. SVG versions of the diagrams were produced with the help of [svg-buddy](https://github.com/phauer/svg-buddy) to embed fonts into the SVG files and overcome a limitation of OmniGraffle's SVG output.
